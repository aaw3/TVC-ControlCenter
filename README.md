[Archived Code] Updated Control Center for TeamViewerController

Program to remotely administer multiple computers easily. Can control screen, keyboard, view remote screen, lock remote computer, and run shell commands.
This program can do basic administration, however if more control is needed, it can spawn TeamViewer for remote desktop access.

This code also has not been tested in years so might not work as intended.
This program should only be ran on computers owned by the user.
